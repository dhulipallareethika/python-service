The Student Information Component manages personal profiles, enrollment status, and records, while the Academic/Course Management Component handles curriculum planning, course scheduling, and registrations. To support day-to-day operations, the system includes a Grading & Assessment Component for tracking marks and generating report cards, and a Financial/Billing Component to manage tuition fees and payments. All these modules communicate with a Central Database through a data access layer, ensuring that information—such as a student's grade or a paid invoice—is synchronized and secure across the entire institution.",
